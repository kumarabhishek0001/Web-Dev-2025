to make it clickable rather than using text use html code

// verify the user
-> get token from url
-> validate (find user based on token generated in db)
-> if not 
-> set isVerified to true
-> remove verification token
-> save and return response

//git saved

now we cannot store the password without encryption 

//encrypting password --> byycrpt.js
when to encrypting
    -> save
    -> register
    -> change (resset password)
mongoose gives hooks
    -> lot of activity (save, edit)

git saved --> added password encryption.

1:59 user login -->


//check email 
//check password -->
since it is encrypted(hashed) --> cannot be converted back to orginal so we also need to hash user provided password to make it same and a check 

//session
user --> let me go to /profile
when requested by user check the database wheather the db have active token

we also have a stateless login --> JWT
